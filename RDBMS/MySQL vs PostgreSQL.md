**Usage / General Perception**\
*Kenn Ejima: "My general recommendation is that if you want to build a consumer oriented app that aims to scale over millions of active users, MySQL might be a better choice. Otherwise, PostgreSQL is better especially if you donâ€™t have experience with MySQL before."\
\
MySQL works best for online transactions, and PostgreSQL works best for append only, analytical processes such as data warehousing. PostgreSQL is widely used in large systems where read and write speeds are crucial and data needs to validated. PostgreSQL performs well in OLTP/OLAP systems when read/write speeds are required and extensive data analysis is needed. MySQL is a widely chosen for web based projects that need a database simply for straightforward data transactions. MySQL may under perform when strained by heavy loads.*

| Features | MySQL | PostgreSQL |
|---|---|---|
| **License** | Open source and comercial versions via Oracle | Completely open source |
| **Clients** | GitHub, US Navy, NASA, Tesla, Netflix, WeChat, Facebook, Zendesk, Twitter, Zappos, YouTube, Spotify | Apple, BioPharm, Etsy, IMDB, Macworld, Debian, Fujitsu, Red Hat, Sun Microsystem, Cisco, Skype |
| **Ecosystem** | MySQL has a vigorous ecosystem with variants such as MariaDB, Percona, Galera, etc. as well as storage engines other than InnoDB, but that can also be overwhelming and confusing. | PostgreSQL has had limited high-end options, but that will change with new features introduced with the latest version. |
| **MVCC** | Yes | Yes |
| **Governance** | Oracle | PostgreSQL has a solid history of working governance and collaborative community. |
| **Architectural**  | Single process | Multi process |
| **Concurrency** | Multi Thread (default stack size of a thread is at 256KB on 64-bit platforms) | Fork approach. Postgres forks off a child process to establish a connection, it can take up to 10 MB per connection. Pay attention to this if you need a lot of connections, 1000+) |
| **ACID Compliance**  | MySQL is partially ACID compliant. Previous version may not follow ACID. InnoDB and NDB Cluster Storage engines adhere closely to the ACID model. | Fully ACID compliant |
| **SQL Compliance**  | MySQL is partially compliant on some of the versions. PostgreSQL queries are, in most cases, exactly the same as MySQL queries. | Largely SQL compliant. MySQL queries are, in most cases, exactly the same as PostgreSQL queries. |
| **UPDATEs** | In-Place / Rollback Segments | Append Only / HOT. It was another reason why Uber switched away from PostgreSQL. |
| **CTEs**  | Starting with MySQL 8 it supports Common Table Expressions , both nonrecursive and recursive.  | Yes |
| **Window Functions**  | Starting with MySQL 8 it supports window functions that, for each row from a query, perform a calculation using rows related to that row.  | Yes |
| **Materialized View**  |  Is missing natively in MySQL, but it could be developed easily with SQL logic. | Yes. To create a materialized view, you use the CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW. |
| **Temporary Tables** | Yes | Yes |
| **JSON Support** | Yes. Improved in MySQL 8. | Yes |
| **Full-text Search** | Yes | Yes |
| **GIS/SRS** | Geospatial data support is built in. Improved in MySQL 8. | PostgreSQL supports Geospatial data via the PostGIS extension. Easy to use for developers. |
| **NoSQL** |  MySQL (5.7+) support some NoSQL features and constantly add more | PostgreSQL supports many NoSQL features |
|**Access Methods** | All standards | All standards |
| **Regular expression** | Yes. Before MySQL 8, regular expressions were supported via the Henry Spencer regular expression library. Starting with MySQL 8, regular expression support has been reimplemented using International Components for Unicode (ICU), which provides full Unicode support and is multibyte safe. | Yes. There are three separate approaches to pattern matching provided by PostgreSQL. LIKE operator, the more recent SIMILAR TO operator (added in SQL:1999), and POSIX-style regular expressions. |
| **Extensible Type System** | Some support. For example we can add new functions. | Some support. It is possible to add new types, new functions, new index types, etc. |
| **Connection Management** | Starting with MySQL 8, MySQL Server now permits a TCP/IP port to be configured specifically for administrative connections. |  Does not support a dedicated port. |
| **Security** | In some previous versions, MySQL distribution must be built with SSL support(e.g., MySQL 5.5). In MySQL 8, it supports encrypted connections using the TLSv1, TLSv1.1, and TLSv1.2 protocols. | SSL support |
| **Garbage Collection** | Purge Threads. Runs with dedicated threads inside the separate rollback segment. It doesn't affect the read concurrency in any way. | Auto-vacuum Processes. Is very costly as it works in the main heap area.  Gives you pause at random as the Java GC. |
| **Table Structure** | Clustered Index (preferable to have, lookup by PK trigger a single I/O). Rows are directly embedded inside the B-tree structure of its primary key. For large amount of memory, both clustered and non-clustered are ok. | Heap (non-clustered, lookup by PK trigger at least two I/O, not FK and joins friendly). Regular table structure filled with data rows separately from indexes. For large amount of memory, both clustered and non-clustered are ok. |
| **Indexing**  | Most MySQL indexes (PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, INDEX, and FULLTEXT) are stored in B-trees. Exceptions: Indexes on spatial data types use R-trees; MEMORY tables also support hash indexes; InnoDB uses inverted lists for FULLTEXT indexes. | PostgreSQL provides several index types: B-tree, Hash, GiST, SP-GiST, GIN and BRIN. Each index type uses a different algorithm that is best suited to different types of queries. By default, the CREATE INDEX command creates B-tree indexes, which fit the most common situations. |
| **Deployment** | MySQL was written in C and C++. It has support for the following programming languages: C, C++, Delphi, Perl, Java, Lua, .NET, Node.js, Python, PHP, Lisp, Go, R, D, Erlang. Again, cloud-based implementation and platform support are available. Customers can choose to use the Oracle Corporation or the open-source build. Both databases are available on multiple operating systems. | PostgreSQL was written in C. It has support for the following programming languages: C++, Delphi, Perl, Java, Lua, .NET, Node.js, Python, PHP, Lisp, Go, R, D, Erlang. Typical installations are on various Linux servers, cloud-based or on premise. Leading cloud vendors have PostgreSQL support on their platforms. There is also a REST API for any Postgres database. Both databases are available on multiple operating systems. |
| **Replication** | MySQL supports Master-Standby replication. Replications offered by MySQL: Single master to one standby, Single master to multiple standbys, Single master to one standby to one or more standbys, Circular replication (A to B to C and back to A), Master to master. MySQL replication is one-way asynchronous replication where one server acts as a master and others as slaves. You can replicate all databases, selected databases or even selected tables within a database. MySQL Cluster is a technology providing shared-nothing (no single point of failure) clustering and auto-sharding (partitioning) for the MySQL database management system. Internally MySQL Cluster uses synchronous replication through a two-phase commit mechanism to guarantee that data is written to multiple nodes. This contrasts with what is usually referred to as "MySQL Replication", which is asynchronous. | PostgreSQL supports Master-Standby replication and introduced significant enhancements producing extremely fast WAL processing that results in almost real-time replication and hot standby capabilities for standby servers. Replications offered by PostgreSQL: Single master to one standby, Single master to multiple standbys, Hot Standby/Streaming Replication, Bi-Directional replication, Logical log streaming replication, Cascading replication. PostgreSQL has synchronous replication (called 2-safe replication), that utilizes two database instances running simultaneously where your master database is synchronized with a slave database. Unless both databases crash simultaneously, data won't be lost. With synchronous replication, each write waits until confirmation is received from both master and slave. |
| **Replication Log** | Separate (Binlog) | WAL |
| **Logical replication** | Yes | Yes. Added in PostgreSQL 10. Thanks to logical replication, zero downtime upgrade is possible by creating a replica with a newer version of Postgres and switching over to it. Truncating a stale partition in a huge time-series event table is much easier, too. |
| **Semi-synchronous Replication** | Yes | Yes. Added in PostgreSQL 10. |
| **Declarative Partitioning** | Yes | Yes. Added in PostgreSQL 10. |
| **Page Compression** | Transparent. Both Postgres and MySQL have page-based physical storage. (8KB vs 16KB). MySQL has a sophisticated feature called Transparent Page Compression. It is specifically designed to work better with SSDs, where write volume is directly correlated to the device's lifetime. Compression on MySQL works not only on off-page large objects, but on all pages. It does that by using hole punching in a sparse file, which is supported by modern filesystems such as ext4 or btrfs. | Both Postgres and MySQL have page-based physical storage. (8KB vs 16KB). Postgres uses TOAST, a dedicated shadow table storage. The large object is pulled out when and only when the row and column is selected. In other words, a large chunk of black box won't pollute your precious cache memory. It also supports compression on the TOASTed objects. |
| **Transaction Log** | REDO Log (WAL). MySQL maintains two separate logs: 1. InnoDB-specific redo logs for crash recovery, and 2. binary log for replication and incremental backup. | WAL. Postgres has a single source of truth for transaction history called Write Ahead Log (WAL). |
